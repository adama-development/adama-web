# Internationalization

i18n is managed through an opensource library : http://angular-translate.github.io.

You'll need to set all i18n keys into app/scripts/translation.js.

Into HTML, you'll have to use the "translate" filter :

	{{ ::'SIGNIN_FORM_PASSWORD' | translate }}

Notice how we have prefixed the key with one-time-binding" notation : "::".

You can also use the translate directive :

	<span translate>SIGNIN_FORM_PASSWORD</span>
